# StackOversite

This is a management system for scraping data from the stackexchange suite of websites. It will offer a client-side gui for managing tasks remotely, concurrent task scraping, progress updates and notifications, a database for efficiently storing the resulting data, and the ability to resume tasks should something unexpected happen.

It is not quite ready to be user friendly yet, but if you want to try it out you will probably be able to figure it out if you look at example.py
Or just run example.py to see it work!
